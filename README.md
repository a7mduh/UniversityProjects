This is a junior year project for the Concepts of Programming Languages course. This project's aim is to distinguish among different programming paradigms: imperative, logical, and functional programming. We implemented Tic-Tac-Toe using Java for the imperative part, Python for the functioanl part, and prolog for the logical part.
