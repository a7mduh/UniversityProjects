These are junior year mini projects for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms. They are about implementing a variety of algorithms. <br />Project 1: insertion sort, merge sort, and binary search. 
<br />Project 2: The maximum-subarray problem in brute-force and divide-and-conquer approaches, strassen algorithm, and an algorithm for lower bounds of sorting using decision trees.
<br />Project 3: Fractional knapsack problem with the greedy approach, and Huffman codes.
<br />Project 4: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and Topological sort.
